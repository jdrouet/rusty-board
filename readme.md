# Rusty Board

Rusty board is (will be) a project management tool such as Trello but open source and with a goal
to be lightweight and have a low energy consumption.

## Goals

### Small footprint

Rusty Board puts a high importance on energy consumption, on the client side and on the server side.
Therefore, for the client, the goal is to have few resources and to keep them as small as possibles.
For the server, the memory and CPU footprint have to be as small as possible while keeping a good
performance. The binary should be as small as possible as well.

### Simple

Rusty Board will not integrate a authentication layer (but will allow to be plugged to one later).
It should have most of the basic features a tool like Trello has.

## Alternatives

- [Trello](https://trello.com): closed source
- [KanBoard](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard): open source project written in PHP
